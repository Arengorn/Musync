# Musync
###### An automated python based music syncing software.
Musync makes synchronizing your music library and your player device easy. It automatially locates missing folders and metadata changes. Transfers are made faster by simply transfering metadata instead of the whole file when edits are made at the library, thus making maintaining your collection faster.

### Features
* Syncs music files between two directories.
* Faster metadata edits.
* Smart file finder for altered file names.
* Highly and easily modifiable.

### Under development Features
* MP3 support, only FLAC currently.
* Album art updating.
* Faster metadata fixing.
* MD5 checksum for transfer safety.
* Input folders in command line
* GUI

### Usage
Simply edit the file and set __*lib*__ and __*dev*__ to your library and device respectively. After that simply run the script with `python musync.py`
